# Tater Timer

We've got an little boy named Tater Tot.

![tater](misc/tater.jpg)

He's a good boy, but he had a rough life before he came to us. As a result, he never tells us when he needs to go outside, and if we wait too long, he'll just sneak off and go somewhere in the house.

The idea with the Tater Timer is to have a device that tracks how long it's been since he went out. In true silly side project fashion, this has been made harder than it needed to be - it's a pi zero with a small screen and a single button attached.

## TODO list

1. ~~Acquire parts~~
2. ~~Smoke test parts~~
3. ~~Demo python code running on pi for screen~~
4. Demo python code for button / LED via GPIO
5. ~~Solder parts together~~
6. ~~Design case~~
7. Print case
8. Implement local program
9. Implement server version
10. Implement Alexa integration with server version
11. Replace this list in this readme with a picture of the finished working product
